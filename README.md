# 🚀 Git-Master: Modular Git Toolbox in Bash

Git-Master is a powerful, modular CLI-based Git assistant built with Bash scripting. It wraps common Git operations into a structured, interactive, and auditable workflow with minimal effort and maximum control.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Branch Management (create, switch, delete)
- ✅ Push Strategies (standard, force, upstream, tag)
- ✅ Pull Strategies (merge, rebase, fast-forward)
- ✅ Stash Handling (create, apply, drop, clear)
- ✅ Reset & Revert Modes (soft, mixed, hard, revert commits)
- ✅ Clone Customization (shallow, branch-specific)
- ✅ Interactive Menus with Prompt Validation
- ✅ JSON-based Structured Logging (logger.sh)

## 🧱 Project Structure

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run Git-Master, ensure the following are installed:

- **Git** – installed and configured
- **Bash** – Recommended on Linux, macOS, or Windows WSL
- **jq** – used for logging in JSON format

### 📥 Install jq on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install jq
```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-master.git
cd git-master
```

### 2. Make Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x git-master.sh common_utils.sh logger.sh lib/*.sh
```

### 3. Launch Git-Master

```bash
./git-master.sh
```

## 📝 Logging Mechanism

All actions are logged to a structured JSON file: `git_activity_log.json`

Each log entry contains:

- ⏱️ Timestamp (ISO 8601)
- 🧠 Script name (push.sh, stash.sh, etc.)
- ⚠️ Log level (INFO, SUCCESS, ERROR, WARNING)
- 💬 Message
- 🆔 Unique Serial Key (e.g., PSIN01, BRSU02)

### 📄 Example Log Entry

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-09T19:45:21Z",
  "level": "SUCCESS",
  "script": "branch.sh",
  "message": "Switched to branch 'dev'",
  "serial_key": "BRSU03"
}
```

## 🧠 Use Cases

- 🚀 Speed up routine Git workflows
- 🪵 Keep a clear log of Git actions
- 🧪 Safely test revert/reset operations
- 🧰 Integrate into larger DevOps toolchains

## 🧪 Example Workflows

### 🏷️ Creating and Switching Branches

```bash
./git-master.sh
# Choose "Branch Management" > "Create Branch"
```

### ⛴️ Pushing with Upstream

```bash
# Inside the tool
# Navigate to "Push Strategies" > "Push with Upstream"
```

### 🧼 Clearing All Stashes

```bash
# From the main menu
# Go to "Git Stash Operations" > "Clear All Stashes"
```

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

Each sub-script is built to be modular, with shared validation and logging handled by:

- **common_utils.sh** – for input checks, confirmation prompts
- **logger.sh** – centralized JSON logging system

Sub-features live in the `lib/` folder and are executed from `git-master.sh`.
